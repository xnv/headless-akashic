> Japanese Documentation is also [available (ja)][guide-ja]. 日本語の文書は[こちら (ja)][guide-ja].

**headless-akashic** is a headless version of [Akashic Sandbox (ja)][sandbox].
You can run games using [Akashic Engine (ja)][ae] on [Node.js][node], without Web browsers.
Useful for unit testing.

> Unfortunately, Akashic Engine does not provide English documentation yet.
> Whole this library is documented in English just to be prepared for their future translation.
> You need to know Japanese to use this library in practice, at least currently.
